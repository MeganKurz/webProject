Arctic Char

Sauce
3 Tbl. soy sauce
3 Tbl. honey
2 Tbl. dry sherry
2 tsp. peeled, finely chopped gingerroot
2 tsp. olive oil

Fish
Vegetable oil or vegetable oil spray for brushing the grill grate
4 boneless arctic char fillets, skin on (about 6 oz. each)

In a small bowl, combine all the sauce ingredients. 
Start the grill.
Then the grill is hot, remove the grill grate, spray or brush it with the vegetable oil, then replace the grate on the grill.
Place the Arctic Char on a platter, and pour enough sauce over the fish to coat the fish thoroughly, reserving the rest of the 
sauce for basting.
Place the fish, flesh side down, on the grill, and grill the fish for 3 to 4 minutes, basting it several times with the reserved sauce. 
Turn the fillets, and continue grilling them, while basting frequently, for 3 to 4 minutes, or until they are just done.
