Newfoundland And Labrador Food and Drink
The province boasts a hearty cuisine.
Specialities: 
- Dishes make full use of fat pork, molasses, salt fish, salt meat, boiled vegetables and soups.
- Crubeens (Irish pickled pigs' feet).
- Cod made into stews and fish cakes, or eaten fried, salted, dried or fresh - often 
with scrunchions, crunchy bits of fried fat pork. Salmon, trout and halibut are also available.
- Brewis is a hard water biscuit that needs soaking in water to soften, then gentle 
cooking; damper dog is a type of fried bread dough.
- Jigg's dinner (a mixture of salt beef, potatoes, carrots, cabbage and turnips) with pease 
pudding, a traditional family meal.
Regional drinks: 
Available brews include Black Horse, Jockey Club and Dominion Ale, and a variety of ales from Newfoundland-based
Storm Brewing (including a hemp ale, a raspberry wheat ale and a coffee porter).
Screech is Jamaican-style rum that is the historic result of trade between Newfoundland and 
Jamaica (Jamaica got salt cod in return).
Tea and Carnation milk.

2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 
1/2 pound bacon, diced
