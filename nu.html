Nunavut Food and Drink
Known as 'country food', the cuisine of Nunavut is mostly based around subsistence living 
and products that come from hunting and fishing.
Specialities: 
• Arctic char (with a taste somewhere between salmon and trout) is served in many ways - as well 
as sampling it stewed, baked or smoked, try it dried for a true northern experience.
• Mussels, scallops (especially from Cumberland Sound), clams, turbot (especially from the Baffin region)
and Greenland shrimp.
• Musk ox and caribou.
• Local bannock (a simple unleavened bread dough cooked slowly in a frying pan, baked or boiled), which kept
 for weeks in an easily transportable form, was a favourite of early Arctic explorers.
• Raw whale blubber and skin, known as maktaaq or muktuk, is a highly prized local speciality - despite whaling 
being frowned upon internationally.
Regional drinks: 
Melting glacier ice is collected and provides water in many communities. Bottled water is available.
