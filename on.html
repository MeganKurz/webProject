Ontario Food and Drink
You can enjoy international cuisine in all major towns. Toronto is rated as one of the best cities for dining out on 
the continent. Bars and restaurants offer an international selection 
of alcohol. Each September, the Niagara Wine Festival is held in St Catharines. Alcohol is sold 
in Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) outlets. Domestic beer is available at outlets known simply as The Beer Store 
and at some LCBO stores. Domestic wines are also sold through company stores.
Specialities: 
- Maple syrup can accompany everything, from waffles and toast to pancakes and even baked beans!
- As well as a wide range of artisanal cheeses, Ontario producers make outstanding cheddars.
- Try one of the dazzling varieties of fish from the countless lakes and rivers.
Regional drinks: 
- Icewine: a sweet dessert wine with a tantalising complexity of flavours.
- Ontario has extensive vineyards providing much of Canada's wine.
