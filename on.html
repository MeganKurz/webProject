Ontario Food and Drink
You can enjoy international cuisine in all major towns. Toronto is rated as one of the best cities for dining out on 
the continent. Bars and restaurants offer an international selection 
of alcohol. Each September, the Niagara Wine Festival is held in St Catharines. Alcohol is sold 
in Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) outlets. Domestic beer is available at outlets known simply as The Beer Store 
and at some LCBO stores. Domestic wines are also sold through company stores.
Specialities: 
- Maple syrup can accompany everything, from waffles and toast to pancakes and even baked beans!
- As well as a wide range of artisanal cheeses, Ontario producers make outstanding cheddars.
- Try one of the dazzling varieties of fish from the countless lakes and rivers.
Regional drinks: 
- Icewine: a sweet dessert wine with a tantalising complexity of flavours.
- Ontario has extensive vineyards providing much of Canada's wine.

Fish and chips 

1 3/4 c. all purpose flour
1 tsp. baking soda
Salt and pepper
1 tbsp. white vinegar
Approximately 1 c. liquid (1/2 beer, 1/2 water)
2 tbsp. fresh white fish fillets (cod or haddock)
Oil for deep frying
2 lb. potatoes, peeled into thin strips

Mix the dry ingredients in a large bowl. Mix the liquids in a measuring cup. Make a well in the center and 
gradually add the liquid to make a smooth batter. If it is too thick, add a little more water. Allow the batter 
to stand for about 1 hour. Rinse the potatoes after peeling and slicing into thin strips. Dry and sprinkle them 
with salt before deep frying to golden.
Dip the fish into flour and then in batter and place skin side down into the hot oil. (The fish should rise to 
the surface within a minute if the oil is hot enough.) When the underside is golden, turn to finish the topside 
(approximately 5 to 10 minutes depending upon thickness of the fish). Yields 6 servings.
