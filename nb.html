New Brunswick Food and Drink
The province is famous for seafood. Fredericton, Saint John and Moncton offer international cuisine.
Specialities: 
• Seafood highlights include lobster from Shediac and delicately flavoured Atlantic salmon served with butter, 
new potatoes and fiddleheads (young fronds of ostrich fern served with butter and seasoned or used cold in salads).
• New Brunswick dulse, an edible seaweed, is a local favorite.
• Home-made baked beans and steamed brown bread are served as traditional Saturday 
night supper.
• Rapée pie, made with chicken, is an Acadian speciality for Sundays or festivals.
• La râpure is a potato and salted pork dish.
