Alberta Food and Drink
Alberta's prairie is ideal for cattle rearing and its Western beef is world famous. 
Apart from traditional foods, Alberta's towns and cities offer an excellent range of international cuisine. 
Alcohol is sold in 'liquor stores', although beer may be obtained in many hotels.
Specialities: 
� Beef is barbecued, braised, grilled, minced and skewered with different complements such as onions, mushrooms, 
green peppers, rice, sauces and beans; Alberta beef is renowned worldwide and is extraordinarily succulent. 
� Stew (combination of diced steak, garden vegetables and biscuits cooked in rich gravy). 
� Wild berries and nuts are used in desserts. 
� Honey is made from alfalfa and clover nectar and is a widely used sweetener and breakfast food.
