Quebec Food and Drink
Québec proudly reflects a tradition of French culture, never more so than in the restaurants 
and cuisine of the province. French food here is as excellent as in Europe. Immigrants from many 
countries provide a vast selection. English, Greek, Italian, Japanese and Spanish cuisines are all 
available in Montréal and Québec. You can find international menus at all the larger hotels, but are 
likely to come across the best food by wandering around the backstreets of the cities and sampling the 
small but excellent restaurants scattered throughout both cities. The Île d'Orléans is an island northeast of 
Québec City that provides abundant fruit and vegetables for the city. Québec follows French tradition in having 
excellent standards of wine and spirits to complement the highstandards of cuisine.
Specialities: 
- Pork dishes such as ragoût de boulettes (pork meatballs with seasoning), cretons du Québec (chilled minced pork), 
and beans and pork baked in maple syrup. 
- Poutine (French fries with cheese curds and gravy).
- Game, such wild boar, venison, and even caribou and wapiti (deer).
- Tarte au sucre (maple sugar pie).
Regional drinks: 
Wines and spirits based on maple syrup are a speciality of the region, among them maple cider and maple whiskey. 
Apple, strawberry and other fruit wines from the Eastern Townships and other parts of Québec are widely available.
