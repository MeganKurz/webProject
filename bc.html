British Columbia Food and Drink
The cuisine of the province has long been enhanced by English traditions. 
More recently, it has shown a pronounced Pacific Rim (particularly Asian) influence.
Specialities: 
� The Pacific Ocean yields a great variety of seafood, including king crab, oysters, 
shrimp and other shellfish, as well as cod, haddock and salmon (coho, spring, chum, sockeye and pink),
 which is smoked, pan-fried, breaded, baked, canned or 
barbecued, and complemented by local vegetables.
� Fruits grown in the province include apples, peaches, pears, plums, apricots, 
strawberries, blackberries, the famous Bing cherries, cranberries and loganberries. 
� Victoria creams, a famous chocolate delicacy derived from a recipe dating back to 1885, 
are exported worldwide from British Columbia. The original confectioners shop, Rogers', 
is situated in Victoria on Vancouver Island.
Regional drinks: 
Red and white wines, sparkling wines and icewines are produced in the Okanagan 
Valley, and several other regions have fledgling wine industries. All the usual alcoholic beverages are widely available.
