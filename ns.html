Nova Scotia Food and Drink
Seafood features strongly on most menus. The pub district in Halifax is said to be one of the best in North America, 
with dozens of establishments.
Specialities: 
• Seafood galore: try fish and clam chowders, lobster and salmon. Not forgetting scallops: fried, baked or grilled, 
and usually served with tartare sauce.
• Solomon gundy (a herring dish).
• Lunenburg sausage exemplifies the German influence, as do hugger in buff, fish and scrunchions,
Dutch mess and house bankin - all names for tasty combinations of fish and potatoes in cream sauce, onions and salt pork. 
• Desserts make use of plentiful fruit and berries, especially blueberries, and include a stewed fruit 
and dumplings dish called grunt, and baked apple dumplings wrapped in pastry and served with cream, sugar or lemon sauce.
Regional drinks: 
Nova Scotia beer warmer is a glass of beer with a dash of hot pepper sauce to get the blood circulating again. 
Provincial beers include Alexander Keith's and Propeller. 
Nova Scotia has recently become a popular wine-producing area, especially in the Annapolis Valley. A number of good 
vintages have been produced there. 
Canada's only single malt whiskey, Glen Breton Rare, is produced by the Glenora Inn and Distillery in Cape Breton.
