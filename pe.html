Prince Edward Island Food and Drink
The island offers plenty of plain, wholesome, home-cooked food in restaurants. Service is informal and friendly. 
There are also many seafood outlets where you can buy fresh fish and shellfish in season and take it away to cook 
on barbecues or camp fires.
Specialities: 
- Shellfish - lobster, in particular - is a mainstay of the dinner table. Lobsters are steamed or boiled and included 
in casseroles or chowder and salads. 
- Oysters are popular; they may be served with tangy sauce, deep-fried, in pies, scalloped, or in soufflés, soups and 
stews. 
- Prince Edward Island is famous for its new potatoes (small, round potatoes), and a favourite with locals are new potatoes 
boiled in their skins, then mashed and served with lots of butter, salt and pepper. 
- Fish cakes made with salt cod and potatoes
