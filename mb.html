Manitoba Food and Drink
Winnipeg offers opportunities to experience the cuisine of the many and 
diverse cultures that typify the city in restaurants or at numerous festivals 
showcasing the food and culture of the region, such as Folklorama, A Taste of 
Winnipeg and the Icelandic Festival of Manitoba. Rural Manitoba also offers a wide 
choice of restaurants, from the very expensive to the moderately priced with good 
home cooking.
Specialities: 
- Traditional First Nations foods, such as bison, game, fish, wild fruit and grain.
- Bannock, flat bread cooked over an open fire, first brought by fur traders.
- Smoked fish and meats - try some delicious smoked Lake Winnipeg goldeye, or another 
favourite, pickerel.
- Culinary imports include sushi, Ukrainian borscht or a delectable vinarterta dessert
from Iceland, consisting of thin cake layers sandwiched together with a cardamom-scented 
prune filling.
- French-Canadian dishes, such as pea soup, tourti're and sugar pie.
Regional drinks: 
Winnipeg in particular has a number of successful microbreweries, of which the Fort Garry Brewing
Company Ltd is the oldest and largest. Half Pints Brewing Company is also rapidly gaining popularity. 
Both offer tours.
